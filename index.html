		</h1>
	</header>

	<main>
		<p>There are a few useful functions that deal with <code>regex</code> in <code>C++</code> and you can use them in a convenient way. They have been written with <code>std::regex</code>; so you no need to worry about linkage problem and so forth.</p>

		<p>Just you need: <code>#include "rfc/rfc.hpp"</code>, of course of cloning</p>

		<p>Since there are several bugs related to this library, you should be aware fo using which compiler version. And the last bug that I could found is on versions <code>g++ 6.3.0</code> and below. Therefore you should always use the least version, that it currently is <code>g++ 7.1.0</code>.</p>
		<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44735201/stdregex-and-ignoring-flags/44739179#44739179" target="_blank"> More detail about this bug</a></p>

		<p>Also you can read about another bug related to negative-lookahead-assertion <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36294169/what-is-the-difference-between-g-in-android-and-g-in-ubuntu" target="_blank">here on stackoverflow.com</a>
		 on versions <code>g++ 5.3.0</code> and lower.</p>

		<a href="https://github.com/k-five/RFC/tree/master/cpp" target="_blank">Here is C++ version plus examples</a>
		<p>But before: <code>git clone https://github.com/k-five/RFC/tree/master/cpp</code></p>
