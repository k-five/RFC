		</h1>
	</header>

	<main>
		<p>There are a few useful functions that deal with <code>regex</code> in <code>C++</code> and you can use them in a convenient way. They have been written with <code>std::regex</code>; so you no need to worry about linkage problem and so forth.</p>

		<p>Just you need: <code>#include "rfc/rfc.hpp"</code>, of course after cloning</p>

		<p>So: <code>git clone https://github.com/k-five/RFC/tree/master/cpp</code></p>
		<p>Then: <code>cd cpp</code></p>
		<p>And inside <strong>cpp</strong>, you will see <strong>rfc</strong> and inside that directory, you can find all header files. You can use them all or just one header file or even copy any function you like into your source code.</p>

		<p>Since there are several bugs related to this library, you should be aware fo using which compiler version. And the last bug that I could found is on versions <code>g++ 6.3.0</code> and lower. Therefore you should always use the least version, that it currently is <code>g++ 7.1.0</code>.</p>

		<p>Also you can read about another bug related to negative-lookahead-assertion <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36294169/what-is-the-difference-between-g-in-android-and-g-in-ubuntu" target="_blank">here on stackoverflow.com</a>
		 in versions <code>g++ 5.3.0</code> and lower.</p>
